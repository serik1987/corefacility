/** Represents a unified for the the module that doesn't provide its own settings form
 * 
 * Props:
 * 		@param {object} options		Auxiliary options to be passed to the form.
 * 									They depend on certain subclass specification.
 * 
 * 		@param {object} inputData	When the prop equals to null or undefined,
 * 									the resetForm() method will not be invoked after
 * 									form mounting or pressing the Reload button from
 * 									the main menu. When the prop equals to object,
 * 									the resetForm() will be invoked during the mount
 * 									or press the reload() button and these input data
 * 									will be substituted.
 * 
 * 		@param {function} on404		The function will be evoked when the server received
 * 									error 404 during the reload or update. We recommend
 * 									you to use this.handle404 when the parent widget is
 * 									an instance of CoreWindow
 * 
 * State:
 * 		@param {object} rawValues	values as they have been entered by the user
 * 
 * 		@param {object} errors 		Field errors. The field error is defined for
 * 			a certain field (e.g., Incorrect e-mail, phone is not filled etc.).
 * 			This state has a form key => value where where key is field name and
 * 			value is error message corresponding to it
 * 
 * 		@param {string} globalError The error unrelated to any of the fields
 * 			(e.g., authentication failed, network disconnected etc.)
 * 
 * 		@param {boolean} inactive	When the form interacts with the server
 * 			(e.g., fetches or posts the data) its interaction with the rest of
 * 			the world is also impossible
 *
 * 		@param {string} redirect	if string, the form will be redirect to the React.js
 * 									route pointed out in this property. If null, no redirection
 * 									will be provided.
