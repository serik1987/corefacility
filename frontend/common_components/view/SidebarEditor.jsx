/**
 * 	Represents the sidebar where the list of items is represented on the left side of the sidebar while content of the
 * 	individual item is on the right side. The method also supports dealing with routes.
 * 
 *  Props:
 * 		The component accepts props responsible for the filter adjustment.
 * 		Such props must be defined by the deriveFilterFromProps and
 * 		deriveFilterIdentityFromProps abstract methods.
 * 	Also there are the following props responsible for the list CRUD operations
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 	@param 	{callback}	onItemAddOpen			This is an asynchronous method that opens
 * 												add user box (either page or modal box)
 * 												The promise always fulfills when the user closes
 * 												the box. The promise can never be rejected.
 * 												Promise must be fulfilled by the entity that has already
 * 												been created or by false if the entity create was failed
 * 
 *	State:
 * 	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 		The component state represents items found and the loading progress for
 * 		the item list.
 * 		The state parameters are interconnected to each other and some states
 * 		are not valid (e.g., the state {loading=true, error=true} is not valid).
 * 		For this reason, please, don't use or set the state directly because
 * 		this may result to damages. Use reportListFetching, reportListSuccess and
 * 		reportListFailure instead of them.
 * 
 * 	Also, one of the descendant of the ListEditor must be an instance of the ItemList with the following
 * 	props defined:
 * 	@param {callback} onItemAddOpen 			This method must be triggered the the user adds an entity to
 * 												the entity list by means of the entity list facility
 * 	@param {callback} onItemSelect				This method must be triggered when the user changes the entity
 * 												and wants editor to send the changes to the Web server.
 * 	@param {callback} onItemRemove 				This method must be triggered when the user removes the entity
 * 												and wants editor to send the changes to the Web Server.
